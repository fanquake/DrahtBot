  ü§î There hasn't been much activity lately and the CI seems to be failing.

  If no one reviewed the current pull request by commit hash, a [rebase](https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#rebasing-changes) can be considered. While the CI failure may be a false positive, the CI hasn't been running for some time, so there may be a real issue hiding as well. A rebase triggers the latest CI and makes sure that no silent merge conflicts have snuck in.
